Importance of international trade :
foreign trade becomes neccessary on the following grounds.
a. different countries of the world have differnt amount of natural resources. But some countries may not possess such mineral wealth. Therfore, one country has to depend on some other country for natural resources
   which results in need of foreign trade.
b. foreign trade is needed to import goods from those countries where they can be produced cheaply instead of producing goods at higher cost.
c. it is not possible for any country to produce all her needs. production of different commodities needed different climatic conditions. for example cuba can produce sugar, egypt can produce cotton etc. foreign trade among these countries helps all these countries to get all their requirements.
d. international trade has reduced inequalities and facilitiated growth in the economy of different countries.
e. internal trade promotes increased international understanding, exchange of idea, cultures and world peace.
f. international trade lowers the prices of the goods and services all over the world.
g. In the era of the globalization, no economy in the world can remain cut off from the rest of the world. therefore every country has to depend upon some other for one or other.
