/*
A polynomial p(x) is the expression in variable x which is in the form (axn + bxn-1 + …. + jx+ k), where a, b, c …., k fall in the category of real numbers and 'n' is non negative integer.
which is called the degree of polynomial. Create a function that takes two sorted linked lists and merges them into a single sorted linked list. Your goal is to return a new linked list that contains the nodes from two lists in sorted order.
You may assume the sort order is ascending.

For example:
// list1
1 -> 4 -> 10 -> 11

// list2
-1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6

// merged list
-1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 10 -> 11
